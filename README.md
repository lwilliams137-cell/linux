Config files for workstation utility

I included a parametric equalizer for adjustable tone.
I increased the 3.4 kHz gain for clearer vocals.
You can download a customized EQ per your iems/headphones from https://autoeq.app.
It is also a good idea to add a Limiter to combat treble hissing.

Next, I included left & right True Stereo convolver files.
It creates a 3D soundstage for iem.
You can download the entire m7 collection from https://samplicity.com/bricasti-m7-impulse-response-files.
As all effects, lower the input gain to -3.0 dB to protect your electronics from power spikes.

Then, I forced Pipewire to use higher audio bitrates.
Copy the ClockRates files to ~/home/X/.config/pipewire/pipewire.conf.d/.
X is your username.

Also, I included a customized mpv configuration file.
I enabled sharpness and GPU processing for enhanced video playback.

Finally, my favorite free apps:
  * Btop https://github.com/aristocratos/btop
  * Celluloid https://celluloid-player.github.io/
  * Qalculate https://qalculate.github.io/
  * Shortwave https://github.com/maunalinux/shortwave
